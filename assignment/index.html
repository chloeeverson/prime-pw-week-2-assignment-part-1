      I have a question regarding last weeks assignment grading. I got partial for answering "cd .." for how to change to parent directory. What is correct answer?
    </p>

      It also was noted in last weeks grading that I sent the prime academy repo not the forked link? I'm not sure what this means on what I did wrong and how to do it differently for sending in this weeks assignment. Thanks!

      I get that I'm saving copies of my work as I go by using git commit - but how do I access those copies? Can I access them without pushing them to github - where are these git copies on my computer?
